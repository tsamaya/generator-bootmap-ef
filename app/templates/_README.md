# Generated by Bootmap-EF on <%= new Date().toLocaleString() %>

This app was generated by a [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io) generator called [bootmap-ef](http://github.com/tsamaya/generator-bootmap-ef). The original code was derived from the [Bootstrap Map JS](https://github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js) project, which is a simple framework for building responsive mapping applications with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://developers.arcgis.com) and [Bootstrap (ver 3.1)](http://getbootstrap.com).

The goal with this generator is to show the power of yeoman, and enable developers to get up and running with a map in seconds rather than hours.

Unline the [Bootstrap Map JS](https://github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js) we load jquery and bootstrap from a cdn - this will make your site faster and unless you are going to make changes to the bootstrap css files, it's simply much much easier. This scaffolded application includes a gruntfile, pre-configured for much awesomeness.

Once you have scaffolded the application, simply `cd` into the application folder and run `grunt` at the command-line.

This will start up a server that will host your application, and then open your default browser pointing at it. Any time you change a html file, a javascript file, or a css file, the application will automatically be reloaded. Behold the magic of 'live reload'!

Additionally, once you have connected your app to a gitbut repo, you can use `grunt deploy` and it will automagically take the current master branch and deploy it to `gh-pages`, which makes it publicly accessible at [http://<%= gitHubAccount%>.github.io/<%= _.slugify(appName) %>](http://<%= gitHubAccount%>.github.io/<%= _.slugify(appName) %>). Hotness!
